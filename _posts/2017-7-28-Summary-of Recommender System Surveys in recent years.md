## Summary-of Recommender System Surveys in recent years
Recommender system has been widely studied both in academia and industry. Survey is usually a good start for understanding a specific research area. Here, I summarize surveys on recommender system from different perspectives, hope it will help for your research.

At first, I would like to promote the survey I finished on deep learning based recommender system. [Deep Learning based Recommender System: A Survey and New Perspectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07435), You can get access to it via arxiv.org. I am still working on improving this survey, so if you have any suggestions, please contact me via shuai.zhang@student.unsw.edu.au.
