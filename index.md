I am a Phd Student in [UNSW](https://www.unsw.edu.au/) and [Data61](https://www.data61.csiro.au/).
My scientific research focusses upon Deep Learning, Recommendation System, and Internet of Things. 
This is the place where I share my ideas on these topics. [Homepage](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~z5122282/)
