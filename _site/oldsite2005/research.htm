    <h3>Foreword </h3>
    <p> The driving force behind my research is the goal of human-level AI. Broadly speaking, I am interested in using intermediate technologies as well as hypothetical frameworks to bridge the gap between the biological mind and man-made systems.In the history of mankind, there are many definitions to the human brain. However, only very few of them are used to direct artificial intelligence researches. Unlike other sciences, ideas in AI can be subjunctive. In fact, I think that the objective view of the human brain only provides us with very limited clues. This is why a solely bottom-up approach renders the upper limit of the human brain unreachable. By contrast, introspection is an observation technique unique to the study of the human brain. It is where the many definitions of human brain come from. And I believe it is the most important source of evidence for the uncovered laws governing our mind. I have never given up turning these subjunctive results into applicable frameworks, which I regard as my biggest research achievement so far. But I find it difficult to make other people to believe them. I have very few written works on them (perhaps only <a href="download/Human%20Anim.pdf">this paper</a>), yet I have substantial amount of planned research work to do about them. </p>
    <p>Throughout the past years, I have followed the trend in a variety of research areas and applied them in my own projects. I am lucky to be prepared early in my life and have the opportunities to take the leading roles at some research institutes or in school projects. </p>

    <h3>Research field by category </h3>
    <p>For each category of research, I wrote a short review. In it, I expressed my opinions after practicing in these fields through my own projects. They are biased through the narrow viewpoint of project development and I might amend them in the future. Next I gave the links to my relevant projects. All listed projects are documented and finished at least in version 1.0. Further reading section contains articles, thesis and/or publications that I wrote on the context. Please note, I maintain this page less frequently than the publication page where a complete article reference can always be found. Interested readers can order them by writing me an email.</p>

        <td valign="top"><p>I came to this field since 2002 with the vision of an agent-prospered web which was convinced by my subsequence researches. Long ago, I believed that computerized intelligence and the evolving network environment had been mature enough to start populating the electronic world with humanized entities. During 2003, I led a small team through the development of Web Agent Framework. The system is built on top of .Net Framework and web service. This framework of MAS is different from the others because it brings agent concept from the technology (hidden) layer to authorized entity (user interface) layer. It finds out a way where general purpose agents could be immediately helpful to Internet/Intranet users and to establish a visible virtual human-relationships on the network. One important conclusion from this project is that, in the future, intelligent enterprise will embrace agent technology and the popularity of agent system should be first guaranteed on the network before more versatile agent enterprises could exist. </p></td>

        <td valign="top"><p>This field is a vision and lots of applications. When I was writing specifications for Web Agent Framework, I had already came into this realm without knowing its name. Later, when I discussed it with other people, I often argued that the driving force of ubiquitous computing lies not entirely in designing many network situated electronic devices, but more in designing an universal agent society where lots of Internet/Intranet users could immediately be addicted to its services. In other words, I think software application might be a faster way to instill this concept than hardware application. But in the long run, ubiquitous computing definitely will bring more versatile networked hardware in to our daily life. </p></td>

        <td valign="top"><p>Neuron Network is the earliest field of study that I am involved, but it is also the least implemented one (i.e. I have not had any major projects on it for a long time). I adjourned my investigation into Neuron Network, because I had not then found any particular point that I could get in. I had seen the same pattern/method be applied in many different places, such as pattern recognition, data mining, machine learning, bioinformatics, etc. During that time, I thought that neuron network application was as perfect as it is simple. Yet, much of my early passion was about the fascinating world in the system level of the human mind and the delicate models of bio neurons, all of which seemed to be totally neglected in the digital world. <br />
        In 2004, I formed the prototype of <strong>Neural Parallel language </strong> which I later concluded that it was likely to become the next generation high-level programming language. It was designed under the premise that all front end software in the future run in a distributed environment and (co)operate in a manner similar to neural networks. In the new language prototype, physical network logic (topology and certification) is not programmed with codes, but compiled with a visual compiler and handled through runtime environment. Late in the same year, I made an important break through on brain simulation, which resulted in a theory for the human brain. To demostrate it, I have applied it to learning and synthesizing 3D human animations in my game engine. </p></td>
