    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p> I will add my thoughts here. These thoughts are intended to be read by appointed people. There will be no web links to them, since I want each thought to be unique to its readers. Public messages will be announced here, so that everyone can have a look. </p>
    <p align="center"><strong>On The Future of Genius </strong></p>
    <p align="center"><strong>Li Xizhi </strong></p>
    <p align="center"><strong>2004-12-9 </strong><strong></strong></p>
    <p>The one who could trace his own mind about the concurrent events in his brain is a philosopher; the one who can not understand the productivity of his mind is a genius. Therefore a philosopher can never be a genius; and everyone used to be a genius when he was a child. When the brain is demystified, only the capacity and configuration of an artificial brain may be called a wonder. The education of children and the evaluation of human intelligence will be drastically reformed for our next generation. The important thing is that it will not be long for all these things to take place. In the next 5 to 10 years, I believe people with rich and active knowledge will change the industrial of our technologies. But the fact that all intelligence is mortal may not be eventually altered for our generation. Our representatives in the virtual world will vanish by LAW, if the physical selves do not survive. </p>
    <p>The following is my first 14-line poem. It is based on the above short essay which I wrote to tell my friend LinHao my opinions on the topic of genius, education and evaluation. Please refer to the following papers for their explanations: </p>
