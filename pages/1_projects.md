# All my projects
Following are projects started by me. 

## NPL project
* Started: 2004-present
* Website: [www.nplproject.com](http://www.nplproject.com)
   * NPL Code Wiki
   * NPL language service and debugger

NPL(Neural Parallel Language) is a new programming language. It was started as my exploration of coding logics in a networked environment.    
Throughout the years, I have written over a million lines of code with it. All my other projects since 2005 is written in it. 
 

## Paracraft

   * [ParacraftSDK](https://github.com/LiXizhi/ParaCraftSDK)
   * Self Learning College

Paracraft is a standalone 3d animation software for everyone. 
It was my exploration of CAD(computer aided design) using the vision brain (i.e. your right brain).
Paracraft is an extensible tool that everyone can learn to create videos and computer programs.
I am using it to promote NPL language in self learning college to teach students programming.
