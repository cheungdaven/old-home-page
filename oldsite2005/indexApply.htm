      <p align="justify"> This website provides a brief (and a little bit formal) introduction to my old and ongoing researches 
	  on a variety of AI related fields, from software to hardware, from theories to applications. 
	  I would very much like to exchange ideas with other people. Currently I am in the process of applying for 
	  graduate study as a computer science student. This personal website is set up so that people could know 
	  my broad interests in the field of AI in a short time (without much navigation). I have several other informal websites, and personal website agents.
	  This one, however, is different from others in that it uses clean HTML, contains only formal and serious research 
	  overviews. It is tightly organized so that people could read a lot about me in a short time.</p>

	<strong>Personal statement</strong>
    <a name="Personalstatement" id="Personalstatement"></a>    
    <p align="justify">My life-time goal has been to conduct leading researches that will benefit mankind in one way or another. This can be traced back to my childhood when I was so fascinated by the research projects performed by my father, a pioneering scientist and inventor in one of the top universities in China . Growing up on the campus of the University and witnessing all the major technological advancements in 1990s, my interests in science have been developed further.</p>
    <p align="justify">I am currently a senior undergraduate student in Department of Computer Science, Zhejiang University , a leading university in the nation. I was recommended for admission to the University in 2001 with the exemption of the admission tests thanks to my outstanding performance in high school. Since then, I have been studying in its <em>Mixed Class </em>, an elite program for the top 5% students. </p>
    <p align="justify">During these years, I have independently completed ten software <a href="projects.htm">projects</a> for four research institutes in China , initiated three inter-disciplined research projects in Zhejiang University , and published many <a href="publications.htm">papers</a> in several international conferences. <a href="thoughts.htm">The driving force</a> behind my research work is to achieve human-level AI. Broadly speaking, I am interested in using intermediate technologies as well as hypothetical frameworks to bridge the gap between the biological mind and man-made systems. In my recent papers, I have formally outlined my current approaches and their implementations. </p>
    <p align="justify">My current interests and major research background are in multi-agent system, semantic web, game engine for distributed Internet games, new programming methodology, human computer interface and networked virtual environment. I am also familiar with computer hardware, such as HDL, SOC, computer architecture, embedded devices etc. </p>
    <p align="justify"> The extent and depth reached by my current research are attributed to the aura of academic innovation in which I was brought up, the wide range of the knowledge in both computer and electronic engineering, and the rich technical and programming experiences. It is worth mentioning that I started my programming journey early in 1989 when I was still an elementary school student but fortunate enough to be properly guided and constantly given insightful advices by Mr. Yang Lu, a professional software developer and family friend. I have been keeping myself updated with the latest techniques ever since. None of my projects would be possible without these practices. </p>
    <p align="justify">Not only gaining valuable research experience, my leadership also gets practiced in the development of some projects, such as the two teamwork projects at the University Club of Microsoft Research Asia and a one-semester-long software engineering project at Zhejiang University. In addition, my presentation skills have been improved tremendously through the various talks on my latest work that have been given in Zhejiang University, Microsoft Research Asia, Harbin Institute of Technology and Shenzhen Tech-Innovation International, etc. </p>
    <p align="justify">Research is like life, full of excitements and frustrations. I have experienced them intensively in both. Yet upon the retrospection of the frustrations, I find that any single advancement in me could not have existed without them. I would like to invite you to  read my <a href="#tragedy">story</a> in this website. </p>
    <div align="justify">Finally, it is my hope to be constantly improvised by people around me with their expertise, experience and creative thoughts. I also hope to work under the supervision of the professors who are willing to help qualified students to do their own research and fully develop their potentialities.<br />

    <strong>A tragedy and recovery</strong>
    <a name="tragedy" id="tragedy"></a>    
    <p align="justify">In my life, I have gone through many failures and misfortunes. But no one has happened so fast and unexpectedly as in the fall of 2002. I won two silver medals of the male's long jump and triple jump in the university's sports meeting. But the last jump in the competition was also the final one before my 20 th birthday. My left leg was severely injured. I went through painful surgical operations and was confined in bed for over 3 months. Only after half a year, could I walk independently without the help of sticks. When recalling that tragic moment, I could still feel the pain all over my body and a quiet voice crying in my mind ¡°Why this has to happen to me? I have so many things left to do in this world.¡± </p>
    <p align="justify">That semester I was away from school, but I managed to attend all the final examinations; that semester I got plenty of time to reexamine my past, renew my understanding of the same familiar people around me and reshape my attitude towards the world; that semester I was taught an unforgettable lesson about the true meaning of life, obligations and friendship. Fortunately, I was recovering and recovered fast. My college had given me many honors and recognized my former contributions in quite a few student projects and school activities. But I was most happy with the fact that I could work once again in the real world with a stronger personality and repay it with my hard-working.</p>

	<strong>Supplementary</strong> <a name="supplement" id="supplement"></a>
    <p align="justify">Before entering college, I had won several national prizes in competitions on Mathematics, Physics, and English (as a foreign language). During my years in University, I actively participated in extra-curriculum programs such as ACM competition and Math Modeling Competition. I built website for our class and college. I hosted English saloon once. I built the official website for the first Shakespeare festival in the University. I love sports and won silver medals in the university's sports meeting in the male's long jump and triple jump. I love English literature and won the second prize in the College's English writing competition. My registered projects in the University received appreciation from the evaluation committee. I discussed and reported my works to my University advisor Prof. He who encouraged my research and provided valuable opinions. I spent lots of time in the school's library, reading journals and books. I had even published my own articles on Physics in High School. I loved drawing since very young, won several early provincial prizes and maintained it as a special habit for 9 years. I have many large notebooks, in which one can find my daily thoughts, plans and system design scratches in the past 5 years. I have met several people who have influenced me substantially during the early stages of my personal development. Their ideas, training and patience will be remembered for my entire life. </p>
