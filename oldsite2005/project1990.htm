 <h2>My early (not serious) projects: 1990 - 2000 </h2>
  <div class="story">
    <p>This page provides a list of my early projects before the year 2000. They are roughly ordered by starting time. All are completed projects. This page is just for fun and nostalgia. There is no serious research content in it, but it is most important to me, because бн </p>
    <h3>Remembering my teacher: <em>LuYang <a name="LuYang" id="LuYang"></a></em></h3>
    <p>I have met several people who have influenced me substantially during the early stages of my personal development. Their ideas, training and patience will be remembered for my entire life. From 1990 to 1999, my computer skills and related projects had been taught and improvised by one person, of who I maintained a special relationship as student and teacher, friend and brother. His name is <em>LuYang, </em>12 years older than me, elite student then at HIT. That decade of 1990s was the golden time for computer hardware and software. Lived at HIT campus, I kept seeing news of computer technology coming from the outside world. China had then only a few independent explorers probing and embracing the constantly coming tide of evolution. New tools, visions and methodologies were hidden in silent corners, unlike what they were 10 years later when I entered college. Despite lack of these materials, he managed to qualify himself by self-studying and had given me the best advices and lessons in advanced computer programming. To me, he knew everything; and I was his only young pupil. With his lead, we followed the path of all mayor technological advances during that fruitful decade. Later I entered high school and then college, and he flew to the US and worked there. During his absence, I developed my own interest and had started many projects, but he was always the first person that I would write to after each major project release. The passion of writing to him after the separation might be compared to the same passion of seeing him appear in the doorway of my house; because both times, I would get what I needed in his mind afterwards. </p>
