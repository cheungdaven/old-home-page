      <p align="justify">My research interest has been in Artificial Intelligence or AI. To me, AI is a very broad subject. Generally speaking, my work is divided into two groups. In group one, I figure out: what is going on in our biological mind; is there any minimum set of high-level rules governing this process; how they can be best approximated by established computer technology; what applications and implications do they have. In group two, I am doing lots of innovative framework researches regarding the architecture of computing paradigms in the future. I believe that the computing paradigm will be centered on intelligence. My major work time in this area has been devoted to the design and implementation of a distributed game engine. It can be regarded as a platform or networked virtual reality (VR) environment, where intelligent entities are situated and communicate with each other as well as human avatars. One can keep track of my work at <a href="paraworld/web/news.htm">ParaEngine </a>website.<br />

    I love sports and am pretty good at what I loved. However, after the unexpected &quot;<a href="indexApply.htm#tragedy">fall</a>&quot;, I was careful not to play intensive games. Ever since, I play tennis quite a bit. </p>

    <ul>
      <li> <span class="style2">Comming soon! </span> 2005/10/31: ParaEngine's new technology demo executable will be released soon. ParaEngine is a distributed 3D computer game engine that I have been being working at since early 2004. Right now, we have a tech studio with artists, plot writers, programmers and manager. We aim to build the next generation online games. The demo will include a simple test scene, two customizable characters, one complex demo scene with ocean and indoor buildings, an in-game toolkits to put physical objects to the virtual world dynamically, the in-game movie factory plug-in v1.0 which allows users to simultaneously compose and edit as both actors and directors in a single scene, the in-game GUI editor v0.1, and countless other controllable elements. We are on the final stage of testing. For a preview, please see the movie below. </li>

    <h3>Research statement </h3>
    <p>Broadly speaking, I am interested in using intermediate technologies as well as hypothetical frameworks to bridge the gap between the biological mind and man-made systems.My current interests and major research background are in game engine for distributed Internet games, multi-agent system, semantic web, new programming methodology, human computer interface and networked virtual environment. I am also familiar with computer hardware, such as HDL, SOC, computer architecture, embedded devices etc. </p>
