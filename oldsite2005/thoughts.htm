  <div class="story">
    <p>These serious thoughts and visions from me are the momentums to my research and souls of my proposed projects. Any of them is worthy of a lifetime dedication. In computer science, I could feel the tide of innovations in a great many fields matching forward in a concurrent manner. I would like to work with people who share similar interests.</p>
    <p>I will only write very succinctly here; in real life, however, I have spent countless hours on them. Please read in sequential order, since they are inter-related. For more information, please read my articles in the Publication page or email me for in-depth discussion.</p>

      <tr>
        <td valign="top"><p> It has long been observed that our brain is both a distributed computing environment and a theatre of multimedia (internal perceptions). 


 Hence, the analogy of human cognition to simulation system might provide some insights into future distributed applications.

I have developed an extended version of Simulation theory concerning the human brain and implemented it in a computer game engine. A formulation of the theory can be found in my lastest <a href="download/Human%20Anim.pdf">paper </a>on human animation. </p></td>

        <td valign="top"><p>Humanized entities (might be called Agent) shall become common on the internet. Web services shall be exposed through agent communication. Web agents and virtual agent/human relationships shall become as common as websites. It would lead to a new kind of service discovery and organization framework; it would change the way software looks (HCI) and works; it would reform the way that software is programmed. </p></td>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td valign="top"><p>More effort should be put to system level design of human mind. My thoughts mainly come from retrospection. And I will not write them here. Instead, I would like to introduce a way to discern the working mechanism of human mind which I call short-time introspection. In general ways, introspection is about the brain's ability to examine an old state of itself ranging minutes, hours or days afterward. Short-time introspection is about examining the mind state milliseconds afterward and several seconds backward. </p></td>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td valign="top"><p>In short, the golden rule for adults to educate their kids is that children are actually more supreme beings than they are. Adults must kneel before kids, and treat them likewise with respect and full participation of mind. No single adult is intelligent enough to teach a child for 2 hours. Children's brain is way advanced than grown-ups. </p></td>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td valign="top"><p>The driving force of ubiquitous computing lies not entirely in designing many network situated electronic devices, but more in designing an universal agent society where lots of Internet/Intranet users could immediately be addicted to its services. In other words, I think software application might be a faster way to instill this concept than hardware application. But in the long run, ubiquitous computing definitely will bring more versatile networked hardware in to our daily life. </p></td>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td valign="top"><p>I had seen the same pattern/method be applied in many different places, such as pattern recognition, data mining, machine learning, bioinformatics, etc. During that time, I thought that neuron network application was as perfect as it is simple. Yet, much of my early passion was about the fascinating world in the system level of the human mind and the delicate models of bio neurons, all of which seemed to be totally neglected in the digital world. But I believe that the model of neuron network would not only be applied in micro scale but also in macro scale applications. </p></td>
